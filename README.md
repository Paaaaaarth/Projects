# Projects
This repository is a collection of my projects as I explore and learn the world of data analytics. Here, I experiment with different datasets, trying to understand patterns, trends, and insights through data. Many of my projects focus on building interactive dashboards and visualizations to make complex data easier to interpret. I use tools like Power bi ,Python, SQL, and various visualization libraries to clean, analyze, and present data in meaningful ways. This repo reflects my journey of learning, experimenting, and applying data analytics concepts to real-world problems.
