# Projects
This repository is a collection of my projects as I explore and learn the world of data analytics. Here, I experiment with different datasets, trying to understand patterns, trends, and insights through data. Many of my projects focus on building interactive dashboards and visualizations to make complex data easier to interpret. I use tools like Power bi ,Python, SQL, and various visualization libraries to clean, analyze, and present data in meaningful ways. This repo reflects my journey of learning, experimenting, and applying data analytics concepts to real-world problems.

## **Project 1: Historical Electronics Sales Dashboard (2024)**

Data Source: Kaggle

What I Did: Cleaned and prepared the dataset in Power BI by handling missing values, standardizing categories, creating calculated columns, and organizing data by region and product.

Outcome: Built an interactive dashboard to analyze regional performance, product-wise sales trends, and overall sales patterns, making the data easy to explore and interpret.

## **Project 2: Netflix Titles Dashboard**

Data Source: Kaggle

What I Did: Worked with a large raw dataset, cleaned and sorted it in Power BI, corrected inconsistencies, and created calculated fields for analysis and visualization.

Outcome: Developed a visually engaging dashboard to explore Netflix content distribution, genres, and trends, gaining hands-on experience in data preparation and dashboard design.
